Key targets for analysis (will need details for defining states and potential studies to use):
1. Predictors of competing risks of dementia diagnosis (0,1) and death (0,1)
2. Prediction of number of comorbidities (within defined set) and cognitive impairment (MMSE <24)
3. Ordering and determinants of transition to cognitive impairment (MMSE <24 and/or IADL<?), physical impairment (ADL<?), and death
4. Alternative definitions of cognitive states as threshold (e.g., MMSE<24 or MMSE<28 over two sequential assessments) or change in function (consistent negative slope across 2 or more occasions; negative slope on 2 or more cognitive variables)
5. Computation of individualized risk for transition and change in confidence of transition probability with additional waves of measurement (advanced; closed session for our group?)

Preparation of decision rules for creating “states” and for code to create new states on the fly during the meeting. These states should be based on published cut points when possible to permit direct comparison to existing results. Let’s begin a Dropbox library for these papers—I will send out an invite for a Workshop Dropbox folder we can share with all participants in addition to Andrey’s Github.

Papers to read in preparation for attending (targets for replication): Please add to this Dropbox.
