## Objects
- `mB_v2` - model object produced by `msm`
- `mB_v2_60_110` - augmented object with `elect` simulation conducted for the span  from 60 to 110 years of age


 ## Estimation report
 - connects to the `./manipulation/map/2-estimate-models.R` script
 - provides a detailed account of how the models were estimated
 - covers `msm` and `elect` computations
 

 ## Analysis report
 - describes each of the aumented obects
 - breaks each `elect` model apart
 
 ## Synthesis report
 - combines `elect` models for comparison
