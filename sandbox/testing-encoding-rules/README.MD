Testing Encoding Rules

In order to assure that different studies encoded the multistate variables with the same logic, their transformation function can be verified against prosthetic data, designed to represent all relevant response vectors. 

- `data-for-testing.csv` - an artificial example data, aimed at representing potential missing states. Wide, conversion to long format is accomplished programmatically.

- `test-data.R` - contains examples of  encoding multistate variables in wide format and long format. The script represents first attemps at strateties of data preparation for this type of multistate modeling. Note: script encoding multistate mmse, but appears to be incorrect. Apply with vigilance. 

- `ardo/WideToLongDataFormat_Andrey.R` - the script that Ardo sent, exemplifying his approach to data shaping for the multistate modeling. 

- `ardo/tips-from-Ardo.R` - I took the script that Ardo sent and using the same data appropriated the method to my programming vocabulary.
