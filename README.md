#### Rational and Objective
This is a hands-on workshop for the purpose of active data analysis on a variety of datasets during the two-day workshop. We expect this to be a productive workshop with the aim of publishing outcomes of analyses that are developed during the workshop. Although this is also a learning opportunity, we encourage participants to participate in a multi-study papers before publishing independent results.

The objectives of this workshop are: 
* 1. Evaluate sensitivity of using alternative variables/definitions of HLE and Cognitive Impairment/Dementia-Free HLE and replication across studies.  
* 2. Evaluate utility of multistate model for making individual predictions of future transitions and confidence in making individual predictions.   


#### Candidate Studies
*  HRS   
*  ELSA  
*  CHAP  
*  LASA  
*  WLS  
*  MAP  
*  OCTO-Twin  
*  

#### Outcomes
* ADL/IADL
* MMSE < 24
* self-rated health
* diagnosis of dementia
* other cognitive variables (decisions about thresholds and alternative models required) 

#### Covariates
* age at baseline
* sex
* education
* SES/SEP 

#### Additional covariates
* BMI  
* sedentary behavior (phys activity)  
* smoking (various)  
* alcohol use (various)   
* chronic conditions (comorbidity index)



The workshop lectures will be delivered by Dr. Ardo van den Hout (UCL, Lecturer at the Department of Statistics), developer of the R package ELECT that estimates these models. Participants are encouraged to review at the [ELECT web site](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakadl/indexELECT.html ) to prepare for this workshop.
